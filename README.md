# **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**  

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  

This project showcases a complete data warehousing and analytics solution, covering everything from data ingestion to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it follows industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

## **🏗️ Data Architecture**  

This project implements the **Medallion Architecture**, which organizes data into three structured layers:  

- **Bronze Layer** – Raw data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database without any transformations.  
- **Silver Layer** – Data cleansing, standardization, and normalization take place to prepare data for further analysis.  
- **Gold Layer** – The final, business-ready data is structured using a star schema for reporting and analytics.
